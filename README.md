# EiffelBridge

This project provides a simple adapter service that simulates the GitLab â†’ Eiffel integration bridge by receiving and processing **GitLab webhook-like** events locally.
Instead of connecting to a real GitLab instance, a lightweight built-in webhook emulator is implemented in Golang.
It accepts HTTP POST requests that mimic GitLab push events (via curl and JSON files), converts them into corresponding **Eiffel events**, and publishes them to **RabbitMQ** for downstream processing.

The purpose of adapter service to migrate CI/CD systems (e.g. Jenkins + Gerrit + Eiffel) into a **GitLab + Eiffel + RabbitMQ** architecture.

## Components
GitLab webhook emulator â†’ generates webhook events on commits, merges, etc.

Adapter â†’ receives webhook JSON, converts it to Eiffel event JSON.

RabbitMQ â†’ acts as the central event bus (queue: eiffel.events).

Consumers â†’ tools that subscribe to Eiffel events (cli, logging, CI triggers, dashboards).

---

## Deploy
Project includes a deployment script that sets up all components â€” Minikube, RabbitMQ and the EiffelBridge service on your local machine.

Run the deploy.py script from project root to deploy stack:
```bash
$ ./deploy.py
```

Script will:

- Build your EiffelBridge Docker image (if needed).

- Package & install EiffelBridge Helm chart.

- Expose services (via NodePort or port-forward).

- Print final curl + rabbitmqadmin commands for testing.

---

## Tear down
```bash
minikube delete
```
